# After-Action Report: Operation Titan (First Strike)

**Classification:** LEVEL 3 (CONFIDENTIAL)
**Document Ref:** RT-AAR-2025-12-21
**Status:** [ARCHIVE CERTIFIED]
**Protocol:** STRUCTURAL HONESTY
**Date:** 2025-12-21

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The "First Strike" served as a high-fidelity stress test of the **Vault's** perimeter defenses. Initial operations identified critical gaps in application-layer security and documentation OpSec, which were subsequently remediated through Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) updates.

## 2. PHASE 1: INITIAL RECONNAISSANCE
The opening salvos targeted legacy hardware and standard protocol entry points.
* **Target A (Synology NAS):** Attempted anonymous SMB access and SSH brute-force.
* **Target B (HP LaserJet):** Attempted hardware injection via Port 9100.
* **Result:** **FAILURE.** Defense Node `titan-core-01` successfully rate-limited connections via fail2ban.

## 3. PHASE 2: WEAPON PROVISIONING (PROJECT SWORD)
To increase tactical sophistication, the **Attack Node** (`kali-node-01`) was provisioned using Ansible.
* **Infrastructure:** Deployed on Kali Linux with a specialized Red Team toolset (Metasploit, Hydra, John).
* **Logic:** Automated provisioning via Ansible roles; heavy services purged to maximize IOPS for cracking.

## 4. PHASE 3: THE BREACH (INGRESS EXPLOITATION)
The successful offensive vector utilized misconfigurations in the **Traefik Edge Router**.
* **Vulnerability:** `api: insecure: true` exposed the Traefik Dashboard without authentication.
* **Exfiltration:** Performed a raw API dump, revealing internal Docker IP schemes (`172.25.0.0/24`) and bcrypt hashes.

## 5. PHASE 4: OSINT & DOCUMENTATION AUDIT
A "Doxxing Simulation" was conducted against the public GitHub repository.
* **Findings:** The legacy `network_map.md` contained plaintext details of "Tribe" assets (Family devices).
* **Git Integrity:** Confirmed that while `group_vars/defense.yml` was encrypted, the history posed a persistent metadata risk.

## 6. PHASE 5: REMEDIATION & FINAL HARDENING
Following the "Invader's" report, the system underwent a total hardening cycle.

| ATTACK VECTOR | REMEDIATION ACTION | STATUS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traefik API (8080)** | `api.insecure` set to `false`; Auth middleware attached. | **BLOCKED** |
| **Media Stack (8989)** | Port mapped only to internal net; Required `prom-auth`. | **BLOCKED** |
| **Documentation Leak** | `network_map.md` abstracted; "Tribe" assets removed. | **SANITIZED** |
| **SIEM Blindness** | Wazuh/GVM middleware dependency corrected to `prom-auth`. | **RESTORED** |

**Protocol Accepted. System Certified. Architecture Sound.**
